7-2 Portfolio Preparation


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming room currently has an application called Draw It or Lose It, only found on an Android OS. They have come to the decision that they now would like their app to serve multiple platforms for a web-based application that mirrors the functionality of their current app but are unsure of how to go about it. Specifically, the client has requested that the following software requirements be met for the game application:
•	A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
•	Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
•	Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
•	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What I did particularly well in developing this document was making mistakes and submit each assignment to make this document a whole numerous times. My mistakes allowed me to receive amazing feedback from my instructor that allowed me to grow as a software engineer seeing I need the practice to understand what's expected of me. Therefore, after doing this design template for The Gaming Room, I was able to gain the knowledge necessary to break down the client's needs and make appropriate suggestions.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through the design document I found helpful when developing the code once again were my mistakes. My mistakes truly aided me in understanding what was being asked. Once done, I was able to problem solve and develop the codes that were necessary to make the application run as the client expected.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Honestly, there is no part of my work that I would revise because with every week that past in this semester building this application and design document, I had the chance to do them all at least twice. My instructor made sure I knew exactly what was expected and guided me where I could use more work.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How I interpreted the user's needs and implement them into my software design was by being thorough. I made sure that I took the time to dissect what it was that The Gaming Room required to make transitioning from a mobile app to multiple platforms easier. It was important knowing specifics because it allowed me to stay within the means of developing the right design for the web-based application for the client to be satisfied.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

At first, when I approached the design template, I thought I knew exactly what it was that the client wanted but after receiving feedback from the instructor, I had to keep digging deeper. Some things weren't obvious but needed so, I had to develop that skill over the last eight weeks. The techniques or strategies I'll use moving forward to analyze and design a similar software application is to not second guess my own opinions. I rather list all of what I think a design template needs rather than have less and miss everything a client needs me to consider. Also, just like this semester taught me, ask for help when needed and grow personally and professionally with constructive criticism.
